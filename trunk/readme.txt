CODING STATUS: Working perfectly

All code compiles successfully. KeyGen generates valid keys and writes them out properly.
RSA can read the key file fine. When encrypting and decrypting files, the decrypted file is no different from the original input file.

Our pair programming log is in comments at the beginning of KeyGen.java.
